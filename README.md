# Handwritten-Digit-Classification :
In this project we will classify that the given digit is handwritten or not with the help of MNIST dataset
# MNIST Dataset : 
 We have used mnist dataset for training and testing 
 It has 70000 handwritten digit images and 784 features
  # Steps :
  1. Importing Libraries
  2. Importing Datasets
  3. converting the imgage data in 28x28 resolution for visualisation
  4. Separating training and testing data
  5. Shuffling : Maybe each values are not equally divided so we do shuffle
  6. Creating digit detector 
  7. Creating classifier 
  8. Cross validation
  9. Mean : To check accuracy
